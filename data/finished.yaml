  notes:
    - The immune system recognizes invaders by some unique characteristics that the class of invaders shares. For example, almost all bacteria have a flagellum.
    - [H2] The complement system
    - The inflammation triggered by macrophages and neutrophils causes a rush of blood to the area. With the rush of blood come complements (proteins smaller than viruses!).
    - Complements maim the invading bacteria, signal for help and tear holes in the bacteria.
    - Complements are more effective against viruses.
    - Complement C3 attaches to the bacteria first, breaking off into C3b (on the bacteria) and C3a (flies off as a signal similar to cytokines).
    - C3b then morphs to act as a base for more C3s to bind to, causing a cascade.
    - As more C3a pieces fly off, macrophages and neutrophils arrive (by moving towards areas where concentration of C3a is higher).
    - After some time, C3b transforms again and rips a hole in the bacteria.
    - Complements are floating in your blood always (even without pathogens around). If C3 doesn't bind soon, it gets cleaned up (possibly by macrophages?)
    - Complements also act as handles for macrophages to grab onto. Macrophages & bacterial cell wall are both negatively charged. Though this won't stop the macrophage, having the positively charge C3b "handle" helps.
    - This promotion of phagocytosis is known as opsonization.
    - The innate immune system is made up of the macrophages, neutrophils and the complement system.
    - Some bacteria hide from the innate immune system (literally, by creating a capsule to hide the flagellum). These can only be attacked by the adaptive immune system.
    - Dendritic cell (Sample & spit, until infection seen. Snapshot of battlefield.)
    - Negative pressure lymph system
    - Monocyte lymph (can convert into macrophage/neutrophil)
    - Tonsils (sample stuff in mouth), spleen (has monocytes, blood reserves, duties can be taken up by others)
    - duty of lymph system (moving fluid back into blood vessels)
