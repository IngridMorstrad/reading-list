    - "The immune system recognizes invaders by some unique characteristics that the class of invaders shares. For example, almost all bacteria have a flagellum."
    - "H2 The complement system"
    - "The inflammation triggered by macrophages and neutrophils causes a rush of blood to the area. With the rush of blood come complements - proteins smaller than viruses!."
    - "Complements maim the invading bacteria, signal for help and tear holes in the bacteria."
    - "Complements are more effective against viruses."
    - "Complement C3 attaches to the bacteria first, breaking off into C3b, which latches onto the bacteria, and C3a - flies off as a signal similar to cytokines."
    - "C3b then morphs to act as a base for more C3s to bind to, causing a cascade."
    - "As more C3a pieces fly off, macrophages and neutrophils arrive - by moving towards areas where concentration of C3a is higher."
    - "After some time, C3b transforms again and rips a hole in the bacteria."
    - "Complements are floating in your blood always - even without pathogens around. If C3 doesn't bind soon, it gets cleaned up - possibly by macrophages?"
    - "Complements also act as handles for macrophages to grab onto. Macrophages & bacterial cell wall are both negatively charged. Though this won't stop the macrophage, having the positively charge C3b \"handle\" helps."
    - "This promotion of phagocytosis is known as opsonization."
    - "The innate immune system is made up of the macrophages, neutrophils and the complement system."
    - "Some bacteria hide from the innate immune system - literally, by creating a capsule to hide the flagellum. These can only be attacked by the adaptive immune system."
    - "Dendritic cell - Sample & spit, until infection seen. Snapshot of battlefield."
    - "Negative pressure lymph system"
    - "Monocyte lymph - can convert into macrophage/neutrophil."
    - "Tonsils - sample stuff in mouth. Spleen - has monocytes, blood reserves, duties can be taken up by others."
    - "duty of lymph system - moving fluid back into blood vessels."

  notes: 
    - "The initial part of this book uncovers some interesting stories. Like all pseudo-science novels, though, this book sees what it wants to see in the stories. However, the book is still able to reasonably convince the reader to what it says for the first half of the book."
    - "The second half, dealing with social effects on habits, is poorly done. Not just in what it tries to convey, but the amount of attention it manages to retain. It becomes boring, and drawls, without a point. I'd recommend reading the first half of this book and dropping the second."

  notes: 
    - "The book is fine to help you pass some time. The initial parts, with too much detail about preparation, can be a little ennui, but once you cross the wine bridge into spirits land, you will quickly stroll through the rest of the book. The swampy and boring marshlands that fill the appendix can be avoided."
    - "Wouldn't mind looking at his next work on food, but am not itching to go at it - I can wait a bit."
