    - "The immune system recognizes invaders by some unique characteristics that the class of invaders shares. For example, almost all bacteria have a flagellum."
    - "H2 The complement system"
    - "The inflammation triggered by macrophages and neutrophils causes a rush of blood to the area. With the rush of blood come complements - proteins smaller than viruses!."
    - "Complements maim the invading bacteria, signal for help and tear holes in the bacteria."
    - "Complements are more effective against viruses."
    - "Complement C3 attaches to the bacteria first, breaking off into C3b, which latches onto the bacteria, and C3a - flies off as a signal similar to cytokines."
    - "C3b then morphs to act as a base for more C3s to bind to, causing a cascade."
    - "As more C3a pieces fly off, macrophages and neutrophils arrive - by moving towards areas where concentration of C3a is higher."
    - "After some time, C3b transforms again and rips a hole in the bacteria."
    - "Complements are floating in your blood always - even without pathogens around. If C3 doesn't bind soon, it gets cleaned up - possibly by macrophages?"
    - "Complements also act as handles for macrophages to grab onto. Macrophages & bacterial cell wall are both negatively charged. Though this won't stop the macrophage, having the positively charge C3b \"handle\" helps."
    - "This promotion of phagocytosis is known as opsonization."
    - "The innate immune system is made up of the macrophages, neutrophils and the complement system."
    - "Some bacteria hide from the innate immune system - literally, by creating a capsule to hide the flagellum. These can only be attacked by the adaptive immune system."
    - "Dendritic cell - Sample & spit, until infection seen. Snapshot of battlefield."
    - "Negative pressure lymph system"
    - "Monocyte lymph - can convert into macrophage/neutrophil."
    - "Tonsils - sample stuff in mouth. Spleen - has monocytes, blood reserves, duties can be taken up by others."
    - "duty of lymph system - moving fluid back into blood vessels."

    - "The initial part of this book uncovers some interesting stories. Like all pseudo-science novels, though, this book sees what it wants to see in the stories. However, the book is still able to reasonably convince the reader to what it says for the first half of the book."
    - "The second half, dealing with social effects on habits, is poorly done. Not just in what it tries to convey, but the amount of attention it manages to retain. It becomes boring, and drawls, without a point. I'd recommend reading the first half of this book and dropping the second."

The swampy and boring marshlands that fill the appendix can be avoided."

    - "As always, Bill Bryson does pretty well in drawing you in and keeping you drawn in to the story. A little prolix at times (again, typically Bryson), but he manages to pace it well enough so that you don't get bored. One of his humorous works, this had me guffawing at various bits, something I don't usually do when reading books. Unexpectedly, he covers only his earlier life and his sarcasm is a bit tough to pick. I guess that's partly because his childhood just seems so extraordinary you don't know what bits to believe. His opinions and his style of narration (what he considers offensive and what not) reveals more about his personality than the stories himself. A great book for anyone to read, and a must read for Bill Bryson fans."

But, that doesn't matter - the story's good and well told. I most liked his description of people. Agassi is a bit of a melodramatic drama queen, finding conflict and issues where none exist - that's a bit off putting. Maybe he just did that to create a story though. Motivating at times as well."

Probably this has something to do with my expectations being raised midway through the book (on reading a few good reviews), but, I felt the story didn't move too far from where it began. It starts off well, but then - probably due to the number of characters involved - stalls, and never really goes anywhere."

Got to learn about all the secessionist movements (Kashmir, Naga, Punjab, etc.) and seeing how India changed since independence really lets you look at today's politicians and parties in a different light. By that I mean, it explains the shift in parties' and politicians' focus to casteism and communalism. I'd say a must-read for any Indian (who is not familiar with the happenings in India post 1950 already)."

If you've read other books on similar lines, like \"A little history of the world\" (which I found more approachable and whose style I enjoyed more), or \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" then you could skip this book without missing much. I give it 3 stars assuming the other books haven't been read (else 2)."
    - "What you would primarily gain from this book is Yuval Noah Harari's different perspectives, insight & theories on historical matters. However, he conveniently states his conclusions without arriving at them logically. He frequently dismisses things that don't fit in to his conclusions by stating they are \"exceptions that prove the rule\", which reflects a misunderstanding of that phrase as well as the theory."
    - "The sad thing about books like this is that they state many things as given, turning the reader into dumb listeners rather than active participants that can question & learn from this."

    - "What a great (audio)book. Expected it to be somewhat decent, but Anna's completely frank & honest narration really draws you in. The stories are informative - giving you an insight into the world of theatre - and very relatable - when she's talking about her romantic escapades. I also found that the book was peppered with a lot of feminist points, put across so well that you can't help but vehemently agree with all (& wonder why we aren't there yet already!)."
    - "She said her goal with the book was to make the reader feel less alone, and I think I would say in most cases she's succeeded."

    - "The book was alright. The first half of the book about life at the concentration camps is interesting. The second half on his theory (logotherapy) is tough to follow. Take this clause for example:"
    - "If a pre-reflective axiological self understanding exists"
    - "Didn't get that one at all."
    - "The central thesis of his theory (as I understand it) is that man can find meaning in 3 ways:"
    - "1. By dedicating himself to work<br/>2. By dedicating himself to someone else (love)<br/>3. By finding meaning in suffering"
    - "I also found the method to \"let go\" to deal with hyper intention (obsessing over something) interesting."
    - "The afterword nicely summarizes the book, and reading that should suffice to prevent re-reads to understand the essence of the book (it also helps to read it before reading the second half of the book)."

What was interesting was how open Anna Faris is in the book, which lets you feel better about yourself if you have any of the weird behaviors she writes about (and she has plenty). The parts about Chris Pratt's take on life was interesting too. Other than that, mostly fluff (visible from the number of times podcast stuff had to be converted to chapters)."

Even though some parts may seem repetitive (Jung's father's steadfast support of the Communist movement, etc.) there is always something else happening to keep it fresh."

    - "Would recommend for people interested in tech, silicon valley or the story of Theranos."
    - "The story in itself is kinda crazy, so the book is mostly just compilation and narration. I didn't like that it jumped around quite a bit and it was quite slow in parts. In short, Theranos was lying about their machines and processes to everyone including investors. Sunny Balwani was a rotten manager and Elizabeth Holmes a con(wo)man."

  notes: 
    - 3.75/5
    - "Tiffany Haddish has had a pretty unique life. I liked that her story was so \"real\", as was her narration style. To be honest, it got a little repetitive towards the end as there are three stories of her dating people in the book. Also, a lot of these stories can be found in interviews on late night TV shows, which are much better as Tiffany is a lot more expressive on video (which is something, as she is quite expressive on audio as well)."
    - "Overall, it's a unique story that would be sad if told by anyone else, but Tiffany puts her unique positive spin on things!"

      Rating: 3/5
    - "It's hard to rate this book because I truly believe that what was achieved was very important for society and for the world. That said, rating this purely as a book, it falls a little short. For one, the ending feels quite sudden - this still feels like the middle of Susan Fowler's story and not the end.  While the anecdotes about Penn were interesting, they seemed as though they would best align with the Uber story as a series of blogposts, rather than a book."
    - "The audiobook felt a bit impersonal at times, which contrasts with some of the better audiobooks I've read (like those by Anna Kendrick and Tiffany Haddish). There were parts where this was not the case (particularly emotional parts like the death of her father/meeting her husband Chad), but for the most part it felt like someone else reading the autobiography."
    - "I did enjoy the start of the book, describing her struggles with poverty and how stoicism enabled her to single-handedly climb out of it (a to-be recurring theme). The book also details the methodical way Ms. Fowler went about the repeated instances of sexual harrassment, learning from past experiences each time. One anecdote that stuck was about Cmd+Shift+4 -ing a chat out of habit."
    - "Overall, a book I was really looking forward to, but on the whole did not deliver much more than the Uber blog post. That said, its brevity is good (you can always read it and judge for yourself without feeling like days were consumed) and I would still look forward to the next book by the author (if autobiographical, then hopefully after a few years)."

  notes: 
    - "A book that's dense with names and information, although some of it is not very accurate. It really suffers in the way it tries to tell you about history - there is no clear narrative and the story jumps around frequently. Many observations are repeated which indicates the editor didn't really care too much for the book. It also speaks about a lot more than the Indian ocean, including some inland empires, although it starts off saying that's what it wants to avoid (a view of history from the continental perspective). It serves well as a overview to all of history around the Indian ocean from prehistoric times to now."
    - "In short, quite informative and comprehensive (but probably a bit too comprehensive), fairly dry at times and poorly edited."

  notes: 
    - "Less a book, more a collection of notes. Kobe gives some insights into different topics (like injuries, teammates, players, preparation) but the insights are really brief. I feel like this was designed primarily as a coffee table book. The photos are alright, but don't add much for a reader looking to read words on a page."
    - "One annoying thing was Kobe presenting every player as if he had a solution to handle them. The Detroit Pistons (a team that beat his team in the finals) received very little coverage."
    - "While he does elaborate on his mentality, I'm not sure it's one that can be adopted by many and it may even be unhealthy to suggest so (that having such a mentality helps/is required to be great)."
    - "All in all, would recommend this to people interested in Kobe, but not to many others. However, it is quite short (can be easily completed in a day), so you wouldn't waste too much time reading it anyway."

  notes: 
    - "Definitely an engaging book. I read around 50% and listened to the remaining 50% as an audiobook. The audiobook was great as well. The story moves fairly well, and the characters (Strasser, Hayes, Bowerman, Johnson, Jacqua, etc.) are introduced at a fairly good pace so you never feel too overloaded with names."
    - "Phil has a tendency to make his struggles seem incredibly great, although even with the obvious bias (him presenting his story) the reader can see that he is laying some of it on. As others have mentioned, Phil did have the advantage of being able to fly the world at a young age, and having his parents support his ventures monetarily, something he should have acknowledge more in the book."
    - "I was a little sad to read about his relationship with his son Matthew and what to me seemed obvious flaws in how he handled that relationship. It was, however, nice to read about a story where not all relationships were perfect (Phil's relationship with his dad & kid(s))."
    - "I was also a little disappointed to see him defend his practices in factories saying (paraphrased) \"we were better than the others\" and \"had you seen the conditions in the factories before we got there?\". An incremental improvement is of course, good, but Nike clearly can do a lot more. Also, feels somewhat disingenuous to address this in a book (a broadcast mechanism) where the opposing viewpoint can't be heard."
    - "At the end of it all, I did learn quite a few things like how tough it was to get loans from banks back in the day, how difficult it was dealing with the shoe suppliers and how competitive business can be (companies lobbying against you). Would recommend this to anyone looking for a lighter read related to business (or the shoe business)."
    - 
      "Note:<br/>1. For those wondering why the Jordan brand isn't featured, it's because Strasser (not Phil) handled it, and Phil and Strasser had a falling out.  <br/>2. Would be good to have an appendix (or a preface) stating all the characters. Here are some:"
    - "Hayes - Phil's former colleague at the accounting form. Heavy-set, great accountant.<br/>Johnson - First full-time employee. Runner. Requires constant encouragement.<br/>Bowerman - Coach. Co-founder.<br/>Strasser - An attorney on a critical lawsuit between Nike and Onitsuka.<br/>Woodell - Employee referred by Bowerman. Uses a wheelchair. Flies a plane by the end."

  pages: 272
  quotes: 
    - "It always makes sense to keep working at goals without obsessing over how far you're from it or how hopelessly you're missing the mark each time. If you persevere, it will eventually be yours."
    - "The mind only recovers emotionally when it can replace an old memory with a new, more pleasant one."
    - "The path to a happy, unplanned discovery starts with learning. It doesn’t matter if what you’re learning now isn’t of immediate relevance to the pool of resources you draw upon. In the end, these bits – the book you wanted to browse through but ended up buying, the language course you took to kill time on weekends or the guitar lessons you signed up for in college – might just come together one day, unexpectedly, beautifully, almost by accident."
    - "Here’s a lesson in serendipity and limitless learning. Nothing you do, however unconnected it is to your livelihood or your life’s goal, goes waste. You never know when an idea that you’ve read about or heard of, or an activity you’ve dabbled in, will pay off. It’s wise, then, to keep your interests and your learning as varied and broad as you can."
    - "Being confrontational can hardly be a one-off affair. It’s a ceaseless loop. You have to keep clarifying your position and stick to it. There are people who thrive in an atmosphere of combat, tension and conflict – but that has never been my strongest suit."
    - "Bottling up emotions, even if done bit by bit, one tiny instance after another, can cumulatively turn into a giant, unwieldy heap of rocks you can no longer tow. You just keep pushing down the angst, pretending nothing has happened, but the truth is it’s going nowhere. If you bury it for too long, the collection of repressed emotions will simmer and eventually boil over in a fiercer form, often at the most ill-timed moments when you can barely afford it."
    - "Emotions tend to get in the way of clear thinking. Whether it’s impatience, frustration, fury, self-loathing or even premature elation – allowing these to consume the mind results in a loss of focus and distraction from learning, and keeps you from taking the right decisions and achieving your goal. Training your mind to take a step back at the crucial moment and developing cues to organize your thoughts is more advantageous than making a move while your mind is in turmoil."
    - "I’ve found that training for short bursts can be as effective as trying to work for a long time, especially when it comes to intense work where you absolutely block all distractions and focus on the problem. If you work for a long time, then inevitably, at some point, your mind will wander, and your energy and interest will both flag. You may end up squandering your resources. Short bursts, I’ve found, are the most productive – much like brief meetings, or indeed short working days – because they can be intense, focused periods when you stop thinking of everything else and quit multi-tasking. Naturally, when your work interests you, you’re able to work a lot harder during the short bursts. The best concentration exercise you can give yourself is working on something that really intrigues you. In areas you find unpleasant, setting yourself mini targets might be helpful."
